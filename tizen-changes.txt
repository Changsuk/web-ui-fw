For upstream:
0002 - maybe
0008 - maybe

tizen
- get rid of a_colorwidget
- hsvpicker: icon can be done with standard jqm icons and overriding style via .class1.class2 { background: some-other-icon; } - no need for special icons "reveal" and "reveal-left"
- optionheader/css: WTF?! a merge conflict was left in place?
- ctxpopup: Why does tizen unset the background during open? Let's solve it with CSS.
- progressbar: Replaced with the one from jquery UI
- slider: Seemingly extensive changes - check with Max
- toggleswitch: They're using an older version

web-ui-fw
- colorpickerbutton html proto has inline style - why?
- dayselector - they have Globalize
- optionheader: Needs a closer look, because there are extensive modifications in tizen.
- popupwindow: Mostly OK, but widthRatio and style need a closer look
- swipelist: Changed click to vclick, because that's what tizen had
